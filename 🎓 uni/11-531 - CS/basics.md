```python
# do not use one letter, reduction and abbreviation for variable name
# try to name it as much obvious as possible
variable = 12             # "int"
amount = 0.01             # "float"
other_variable = "string" # "str"
is_finished = False       # "bool"

# type casting
base_variable = 10
casted_to_str = str(base_variable)   # str
casted_to_bool = bool(base_variable) # True, bool(0) -> False
casted_to_float = base_variable / 2  # 5.0 -> float
# there are other math operations too: "+", "-", "*", "**", "//"
